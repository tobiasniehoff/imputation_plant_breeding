# the below function is custom made for the imputation scripts. If you provide
# a pedigree, it is looked up which parents were crossed for a specific family
# and these crosses are done again (simulated). But the type of population for 
# parents and the offspring can be specified. For parent_type, 'real', 'DH' and 
# 'F[number]' are available. 'real' extracts the real parents from the provided
# phase object and uses them. If any of the other options is chosen, parents are
# simulated. For that, F1 individuals have to be generated. The F1s are produced 
# with female gametic control, i.e. a real parent is taken and pollinated with a
# pollen cloud of all parents (selfing is possible). Female gametic control is 
# used because I do want F1/DH/F... but these should be as genetically similar
# to the real parents from a diversity perspective so that I don't have an excess 
# in drift.
# 
# For 'offspring_type', 'DH', 'F[number]', 'OP[number]perfamn[number]' and 
# 'OP[number]n[number]' are available. 'OP' means 'open pollination' and can 
# either be done with all individuals or within a bi-parental family.
# The number of offspring can be controlled with 'n_off.family'.
# The number after OP refers to the number of generations of random mating
# AFTER the F1. E.g. to produce an F2, it takes 2 generations (-> F1 -> F2). To 
# produce an OP2 it takes 3 generations (->F1 -> OP1 -> OP2).
# The number after 'n' refers to the population size (number of individuals)
# in any of the generations
# of open pollination, except for the last one. The number of individuals in the
# last generation of open pollination can be controlled 'with n_off.family', 
# even if open pollination is not done per family.
#
# Note that to get the same number of individuals for 'OP2n10' as for 
# 'OP2perfamn10', for the latter case you need to specify 'n_off.family = x' 
# but for the first case it has to be 'n_off.family = x*[number families]'.
# For our data set, the number of families is 36.
